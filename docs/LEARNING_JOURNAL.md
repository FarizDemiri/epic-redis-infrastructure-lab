# Redis Mastery - Learning Journal

Daily progress tracking for Redis administration skill development with focus on healthcare infrastructure patterns.

---

## Day 0 - December 24, 2025 (Headstart)

### Technical Achievements

- [x] Redis installed on Ubuntu VM (Oracle VirtualBox)
- [x] First PING/PONG test successful
- [x] Basic SET/GET/EXPIRE operations tested
- [ ] GitHub repository created
- [ ] Persistence pattern mapped
- [ ] First commit and push

### Pattern Compression

**PERSISTENCE = Thought capturing flow**

- Saw: Living Redis (RAM) vs recorded Redis (disk)
- Trade-off: RDB (freeze moment) vs AOF (record movement)
- Connects to: Trading system state management
- Key insight: *"The present moment captured, stored as the past, and automatically released when it's no longer valid"*

### Direct Observations

1. Data stored in memory (not disk yet)
2. Instant response (sub-millisecond)
3. Automatic expiration (TTL = time acknowledging its own ending)

### Time Spent

- Installation: 15 min
- Testing: 20 min
- GitHub setup: __ min (in progress)
- Pattern mapping: __ min (to complete)

**Total**: ~__ hours

### Tomorrow's Focus (Dec 26 - Day 1)

- Redis internals and data structures
- Persistence mechanisms (RDB vs AOF) deep dive
- Complete master-replica setup
